# safeboard
This is my solution to safeboard contest problem.

Executables are created by executing the following commands:
```
make client
```
and
```
make server
```

Client application takes one parameter: directory to inspect. Example:
```
./client /home/arthur/sus_directory
```
Server application does not need any parameters.
